## Welcome to Sudoku!
User Playable Sudoku GUI with Backtracking to Solve

### V1.0 (March 12, 2021):

This is your average everyday standard 9x9 sudoku game.
The aim of the game is simple. You know it, I do too. 
Just fill in the squares, and you win!
I know right? Can't get any easier... or can it?

If you are unable to finish the puzzle, that's fine. The game with finsih it for you.
Simply select the "Solve" option in the "Game" menu, and you are good to go!
Oh, but wait, there is a caveat. Sorry, no cheating.
Should you choose the route of the forgoing, your score will not be tracked
(right now, it's more of a 'you don't get praise').

The puzzles are auto generated from scratch via the program. So take to the challenge.
Solve and solve and solve and solve and... yeah, to your heart's content!
:D
